# FastAPI city temperature management

## Description
FastAPI application that manages city data and their corresponding temperature data.

The application will have two main components (apps):
- A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing city data.
- An API that fetches current temperature data for all cities in the database and stores this data in the database.

### City Management
- `POST /cities`: Create a new city.
- `GET /cities`: Get a list of all cities.
- `GET /cities/{city_id}`: Get the details of a specific city.
- `PUT /cities/{city_id}`: Update the details of a specific city.
- `DELETE /cities/{city_id}`: Delete a specific city.

### Temperature Management
- `GET /temperatures`: Get a list of all temperature records.
- `GET /temperatures/?city_id={city_id}`: Get the temperature records for a specific city.
- `POST /temperatures/update`: Get the current temperature for all cities from [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/) and stores this data.
